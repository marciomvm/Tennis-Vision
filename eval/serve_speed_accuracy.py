eval/serve_speed_accuracy.py
----------------------------
Measures serve speed against real broadcast radar ground truth.

Where the ground truth comes from
---------------------------------
Tournament broadcasts overlay the radar-measured speed of each serve (the IBM panel
at the Australian Open, the corner readout at Roland Garros). Those numbers were read
off the clips by eye and recorded in GROUND_TRUTH below. This is genuine external
ground truth for a metric that has never been validated in this project.

Two honest caveats, both material:

  1. The overlay reports the speed of the *most recent* serve. It is recorded here
     only for clips where the serve visibly belongs to the point being played.
  2. Radar measures speed AT CONTACT. This pipeline measures AVERAGE SPEED OVER THE
     FLIGHT (see utils/serve_speed.py). Drag makes the average lower than the contact
     speed, so a reading below ground truth is expected - the question this script
     answers is *by how much, and how consistently*. A consistent ratio is a usable,
     explainable measurement. A scattered one means the method does not work.

How this runs
-------------
It shells out to `main.py` per clip and reads `serve_avg_flight_speed_kmh` from the
summary JSON, rather than re-assembling the pipeline here. An earlier version did
rebuild the stages inline and silently diverged from production (different candidate
sources, wrong mini-court height argument), producing "no serve found" on a clip
where the real pipeline finds one. Measuring anything other than what actually ships
is worse than not measuring.

Usage:
    python eval/serve_speed_accuracy.py            # all clips with ground truth
    python eval/serve_speed_accuracy.py --clip 5
