"""
training/train_shot_classifier.py
---------------------------------
Trains ONE temporal model over pose sequences to classify all shot types, replacing
the pile of hand-written geometric rules in ShotClassifier.

Why a learned temporal model rather than more rules
---------------------------------------------------
Shot types differ by *body mechanics unfolding over time*, not by any single-frame
geometric fact. A slice and a topspin forehand can occupy identical positions at the
contact frame and differ entirely in the swing path before and after it. Rules that
look at one frame - which is what the current classifier does - cannot see that, and
in practice they produced 6 backhands out of 8 shots on one clip and phantom serves
on most others. One model over a window of frames replaces N rules with N classes.

Architecture: a small 1D CNN over the time axis. Deliberately small - 243 clips is a
tiny dataset and a transformer would memorise it. Two conv blocks plus global pooling
has enough capacity for swing-shape discrimination and little enough to be trainable
here.

Honesty constraints baked into this script
------------------------------------------
1. **Subject-wise splits, never random.** THETIS has 16 subjects, each performing
   every shot type several times. A random split puts the same person's forehand in
   both train and test, and the model then recognises the *person*, not the *shot*.
   That inflates accuracy dramatically and is the single easiest way to produce a
   fake result here. Folds are grouped by subject.
2. **Body-relative normalisation.** Coordinates arrive in pixels. Each frame is
   centred on the hip midpoint and scaled by shoulder width, so the model cannot
   cheat off where the player stands or how large they appear.
3. THETIS is indoor gym demonstration footage, not broadcast tennis. Whatever
   accuracy this reports is accuracy *on THETIS*. It is not evidence about our own
   clips, and must not be quoted as such.
