def stub_path_for_video(base_stub: str, video_path: str) -> str:
    """
    Derive a per-video cache path from a generic stub path.

    Detection stubs were keyed to nothing: `tracker_stubs/ball_detections_tracknet.pkl`
    was written by whichever clip ran last and then loaded by whichever clip ran next.
    Analysing clip A and then clip B silently gave B the ball positions of A, and every
    downstream number - speeds, bounces, shot frames - was computed from another video's
    ball. Nothing crashed and nothing looked wrong, which is what made it dangerous: the
    evals in eval/ shared the same stub, so a clip could be graded on detections that
    never came from it.

    Keying on the video's filename stem also lets several clips stay cached at once,
    which is what the multi-clip eval sweeps actually want.

        → tracker_stubs/ball_detections_tracknet__clip_05_wimbledon.pkl

    The stem alone is NOT proof of identity, and the frame-count check is not either.
    Two clips can share a filename and a length:

        matches/2026-01-05/rally.mp4     15 s at 25 fps = 375 frames
        matches/2026-01-12/rally.mp4     15 s at 25 fps = 375 frames

    Those collide on the stem, pass `stub_matches_frames`, and the second clip is then
    analysed with the first one's ball positions. Nothing crashes and nothing looks wrong,
    which is the same silent failure this keying was introduced to stop, one level down.

    So the byte size goes into the key as well. Two different video files sharing a name
    AND an exact byte count is not a case worth engineering against; sharing a name alone
    is ordinary. Callers should still verify with `stub_matches_frames`, which catches the
    remaining case of the same file re-cut to a different length.

    A video that does not exist keeps the name-only key: it cannot be analysed anyway, and
    this function is called in tests with paths that were never on disk.

    read the entire file and slice afterwards, which makes --max-frames useless for
    the case it documents: "quick check on a long video before a full run". A 1080p
    frame is 5.93 MiB, so the whole-file read exhausts 32 GB of RAM at roughly 5,500
    frames and dies inside cv2 with an allocation error that names neither the video
    nor the flag that was supposed to prevent it.

    0 (the default) reads everything, which is still the right behaviour for a clip
