utils/player_selection.py
─────────────────────────
Narrows raw person detections to the two players, with stable ids 1 and 2.

Why this is shared rather than inline
-------------------------------------
main.py did this itself and the evals did not, so the evals fed every detected person
into the pipeline: on the reference clip that is fourteen people, and the "player" ids
reaching downstream logic included spectators and ball kids. That is invisible while
nothing depends on WHICH player was involved, and it stops being invisible the moment
something does. The rally grammar in utils.rally_decode depends on exactly that: its
strongest rule is that a player cannot hit twice in succession, and a spectator id
between two contacts by one player makes an impossible rally look legal.

So the eval was grading a worse input than the product ships, in a way that made a new
feature look harmful. The function lives here so that cannot drift apart again.

    Judge a completed selection without any ground truth.

    Why this exists
    ---------------
    The court-validity gate stops a clip whose COURT was fitted to the crowd. Nothing
    stopped a clip whose PLAYERS were. Measured across the nine evaluation clips
    (eval/player_selection_sanity.py), input_video_11 passes the court gate comfortably
    at 0.327 line support and still selects two tracks that sit on the same side of the
    net, one of them present for 40% of frames with a 199-frame hole in the middle. The
    pipeline reported confident numbers on it.

    The check needs no labels because the sport supplies the constraint: singles is
    played across the net, so two tracks on the same half cannot both be players. That is
    the same kind of reasoning the rally grammar and the court gate already use.

    This is a sanity check, not an accuracy measurement. Precision, recall, IDF1 and ID
    switches need labelled boxes that do not exist for this footage.

        selected:        per-frame {1|2: bbox}, the output of select_two_players.
        net_y:           image y of the net line, midway between the two baselines.
