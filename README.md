## The one thing that makes this different

Every number this project reports carries the evidence for it, or it is not reported.

That reads like a slogan, so here is what it means in practice. The pipeline refuses to
print a serve speed when it cannot see the ball land. It flags a clip whose court fit
failed instead of computing real-world speeds from a court fitted to the crowd. It labels
a ball height "unknown" rather than dressing up a guess. And this README publishes the
numbers that make the project look worse alongside the ones that make it look better,
because the difference between them is usually the interesting part.

Two examples from this repository:

- Ball detection is usually quoted as a "detection rate". Ours is 88.6%. Measured against
  hand-labelled ground truth, only **42.5%** of visible-ball frames are located within
  5px. Both numbers are true and they measure different things.
- Contact and bounce detection scores **87.6% recall given perfect ball positions** and
  **72.0% running real detection end to end**. The second one is what you actually get.

Every figure below names the script that produced it.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarshTomar1234/Tennis-Vision.git
cd Tennis-Vision

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate            # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .

tennis-vision download-models       # about 140 MB
tennis-vision analyze input_videos/input_video_2.mp4 -o output/demo.avi
```

`download-models` prints one manual step. The TrackNet ball weights belong to their
original author and their licence is unstated, so they are fetched from that project
rather than rehosted here. Everything else downloads automatically.

Add `--max-frames 60` for a fast check before committing to a full run.

Outputs land in `output/`: an annotated video, a per-frame stats CSV, a run summary JSON,
and an interactive 3-D viewer as a single self-contained HTML file with no external
dependencies.

## Your own footage

The court keypoint model was trained on broadcast tennis: a high, centred, long-lens
camera. Point it at a phone on a fence post, or an action camera behind the baseline, and
it returns fourteen tidy points that are not on the court. The validity gate catches that
and refuses the clip, which is correct and leaves you with nothing to run. On club footage
that is not a rare failure, it is the normal case.

A fixed camera makes this a much smaller problem than the model is solving. The court does
not move, so its position is a property of the **camera**, not of the frame: fourteen
points placed once describe every frame of every clip shot from that spot.

```bash
tennis-vision calibrate my_clip.mp4     # click the court once, roughly two minutes
tennis-vision analyze   my_clip.mp4     # found automatically from here on
```

Click each point as the prompt asks for it, and **drag any point to correct it** - one
you placed, or one the fit filled in. A plan view in the corner shows which point is being
asked for, the point under the cursor is highlighted and named, and `u` undoes the last
edit, whether that was a placement or a drag. Reopening the tool on a video that already
has a calibration loads it for adjustment rather than starting over.

**Some court corners are outside the video**, which is normal on a wide camera close to
the baseline: on the reference clip the near-right doubles corner lands 70px past the
right edge. The canvas is therefore larger than the picture, the video sits inside a
border, and a point out there is clicked and dragged like any other. The arrow keys nudge
the selected point a pixel at a time, in or out of the picture. Nothing out there can be
checked against paint, so `Tab` leaves such a point at the fit's own guess, which is
usually the best answer available.

If the window opens larger than your screen, pass `--max-size 1280x720`. It is fitted to
the detected screen size by default and cannot be resized once open.

## A long recording

A club session is filmed as one continuous take, an hour of tape for maybe fifteen
minutes of actual rallies. Every detector in this pipeline costs the same per frame
whether the frame shows a rally or an empty court, so cut the dead time out first:

```bash
tennis-vision segment session.mp4
```

This is frame differencing restricted to the calibrated court, at reduced resolution -
no model, no GPU. Measured on one reference clip: about 150 frames/second on a single
core, so an hour of 30fps footage costs roughly 12 minutes to scan, against the ~100
minutes the ball tracker alone needs for the same hour. It finds motion, not points: a
rally is a burst per stroke with the ball's flight time as a lull in between, so nearby
bursts are merged with a generous gap tolerance (`--min-gap-s`, default 2s) rather than
each becoming its own clip. What survives is a coarse cut - whole rallies with their own
pauses intact, several-second stretches of nothing dropped - not point-perfect
boundaries. If those matter, run `tennis-vision analyze` on what this keeps, which is
now a small fraction of the original recording.

Without a calibration for this camera, motion on a neighbouring court counts too; pass
`--no-calibration` to acknowledge that deliberately, or calibrate first. `--dry-run`
computes the manifest and prints the summary without cutting anything, and `--plot`
saves a PNG of the activity trace against the threshold, worth a look before trusting a
first run. Every cut is also recorded in `manifest.json` - which frames, what the
activity score was there, on what parameters - so a run that kept too little or too much
is auditable rather than a black box.

A source outside 23 to 31fps - the band every published accuracy number in this project
was measured on, see the frame-rate section below - can be resampled during the same
cut: `--target-fps` (bare, means 30) implies `--reencode`, since a stream copy cannot
change frame rate. Each clip's ACTUAL rate is then verified with `ffprobe` and recorded
per segment in `manifest.json` as `fps_actual` and `fps_support` - not assumed from
having asked ffmpeg for it. Verified on a real 60fps clip: resampled to exactly 30/1 with
no mismatches reported.

## Processing what segmentation kept

`tennis-vision segment` leaves you with a directory of clips and a manifest, not a
single number. To run the real pipeline over all of them and combine what comes back:

```bash
tennis-vision batch-analyze session_points/ --court-calibration calibration/court_A.json
```

One calibration for every clip, because they all share the camera position the
recording was made from - segmentation does not move the camera. Discovery by clip file
name will not find it on its own (a clip is not named like the recording it came from),
so pass it explicitly. `--court-calibration` is not required, but skipping it falls
every clip back to the keypoint model, which is exactly the case a calibration exists
for on this kind of footage; the tool says so if you do not pass one.

Rendering is skipped by default (`--with-video` opts back in) - it is the slowest stage
of the pipeline and nobody watches a rendered video for each of a hundred clips. Measured
on a real ~10 s clip: about 45 s end to end including model loading, so budget roughly
that per clip for a full batch.

**Player identity does not carry across clips, and the report never pretends it does.**
`utils.player_selection` numbers the two people in a clip 1 and 2 by whichever has the
lower internal tracker id in THAT run - not by which side of the net they stand on. Track
ids restart fresh every time the pipeline runs, so "Player 1" in one clip and "Player 1"
in another have no relationship. The batch report therefore sums total shots (both
players together, which needs no identity) and shot-count-weights the average speed
across clips, but never produces a combined per-player total - `batch_report.csv` has
the per-clip P1/P2 breakdown instead, meaningful only within each row's own clip.

Writes `batch_report.json` (full per-clip data plus the combined totals) and
`batch_report.csv` (one row per clip, for a spreadsheet) into `<out-dir>/`, alongside
each clip's own isolated stats folder. `--dry-run` lists what would run without running
it; `--limit N` and `--max-frames N` make a fast pass over the whole batch before
committing to the full one; `--skip-existing` resumes an interrupted run.

**A within-clip hint at identity.** Each row also carries `near_camera_pid`: which of
that clip's two ids sat, on median, closer to the camera - the same "bottom half" the
selection logic already uses to tell players from spectators, just not previously
written anywhere. It is not carried between clips and it does not survive a change of
ends: real tennis swaps which physical person is near partway through a match, and
nothing here detects that happening. It says something true about one clip, not
something true about the whole session.

**A combined video.** `--combine-video` (implies `--with-video`) stitches every
rendered clip into one file, in the manifest's chronological order:

```bash
tennis-vision batch-analyze session_points/ --court-calibration calibration/c.json --combine-video
```

Written to `combined_analysis.mp4` via ffmpeg's concat FILTER rather than its concat
demuxer, so the clips being joined do not need byte-identical codec parameters - a
re-encoding pass, at a cost that is small next to producing the clips in the first
place. Watching it is also the practical way to build your own identity map across a
change of ends: the render already draws "Player 1" / "Player 2" boxes on each frame, so
seeing which shirt is in which box, clip by clip, tells you more than any automatic
labelling in this pipeline currently can.

The calibration is written to `calibration/<video name>.json` and discovered by video
name. One camera position, many recordings: point later clips at the same file rather
than redoing the clicks.

```bash
tennis-vision analyze another_clip.mp4 --court-calibration calibration/my_clip.json
tennis-vision analyze my_clip.mp4 --no-court-calibration   # compare against the model
```

**It also decides which court is yours.** Club footage shows the next court along, and the
players on it are real people the detector is entirely right to find - on one 3,600-frame
clip here it tracked fifteen. Nothing in the image says which court is being analysed, so
the calibration does: people whose feet are outside the court and its playing margin are
dropped before player selection. The margin is specified in **metres**, not pixels,
because perspective makes three metres a wide band at the bottom of the frame and a
handful of pixels at the top. If something is still in the way - a bench, a walkway, a
doubles match alongside - draw an exclusion zone with `x` in the calibration tool.

Measured on one clip of amateur footage, first 600 frames, with everything else unchanged:

| | keypoint model | hand-placed |
|---|---|---|
| Court fit | failed, 0.076 line support | placed and verified by eye |
| People reaching player selection | 15 | 2 |
| Player 1 coverage | 19%, with a 2,439-frame hole | 93% |
| Players on opposite sides of the net | no | yes |
| 3-D reconstruction | refused | 13 segments, 5 shots |

**What it does not fix.** A homography assumes straight lines, and a wide action camera
bends them. The fourteen points are unaffected, since each is placed where the corner
really appears, but anything mapped *through* the homography carries that error. The tool
and the run summary both report it as `lens_error_px`, so the cost is measured rather than
assumed. On the clip above a single homography sits about 10px rms from the painted lines.

**The validity gate does not apply to a calibrated run, deliberately.** The gate exists
because a regression head cannot say "this camera angle is outside my training
distribution". A person who placed the points on the lines and looked at the overlay has
already answered that, with better evidence: the gate samples straight segments between
corners, and on a wide lens the painted line between them is curved, so it scores a
correct court low. The measurement is still taken and still reported in `summary.json` as
`court_line_support`; it just no longer decides. `court_source` says which of the two
produced the geometry.

## What it does

**Ball tracking.** TrackNet, with the position taken from the largest connected heatmap
response rather than the mean of all responding pixels. Ball positions map to the court
through the floor homography only at floor level, meaning at a bounce or a racket contact.
While the ball is airborne the floor homography does not apply to it, so those frames
interpolate between floor-valid anchors instead of being projected as though the ball were
on the ground.

**Court geometry.** ResNet-50 keypoint regression, 14 points, re-detected per frame so
camera pan and tilt are handled, then a real perspective homography via
`cv2.findHomography`. On a fixed camera the model can be replaced entirely by fourteen
points placed once by hand, which is what makes amateur footage work at all - see *Your
own footage* above.

**Court validity gate.** The keypoint model is a plain regression head with no way to say
"this camera angle is outside my training distribution". On unfamiliar footage it returns a
tidy quadrilateral that is simply not on the court, and every real-world measurement
downstream is then computed from it and reported with full confidence. That failure is
worse than a crash because the output looks plausible. The gate samples along every
predicted line and asks whether those pixels are actually brighter than the surface a few
pixels to either side. A predicted line lying on the crowd fails; one lying on paint
passes.

**Player tracking.** YOLOv8x with ByteTrack, then a six-criteria selection aggregated
across the whole clip. Frame-zero selection was the original approach and it failed on real
footage: on one eval clip the true player is a track id that does not exist at frame zero.

**Event detection.** Three candidate generators feed a union, because each is blind to a
different event shape. y-reversal and x-velocity are hit-shaped by construction, and a
dedicated bounce generator covers what they miss. A trained trajectory classifier then
splits contacts from bounces.

**Serve detection and speed.** A serve is the only shot that is simultaneously struck
above the player's head and from the baseline or behind it. Both conditions must hold, each
is independently measurable, and a rejection reports which one failed. Speed comes from the
contact and the landing, both floor-valid, and is not reported at all when the landing is
never observed inside the service box.

**3-D reconstruction.** Between two known contacts the ball follows a parabola whose
curvature is gravity and whose endpoints are known heights, so there are no free
parameters. Height is modelled from those anchors rather than measured from the image,
because at broadcast camera angles raising the ball and pushing it further away move it in
almost the same image direction. A free ballistic fit can match the picture to a pixel
while being metres wrong in space.

**Shot classification.** Serve comes from physical evidence. Volley and Smash are tested
against physical evidence and, when none is found, downgraded to "Groundstroke" rather
than reported: across 9 clips and 81 shots that layer evidences 1 and rejects 20, so it
is a validation filter and is described as one. Forehand and backhand come from a
pose-based body-geometry test via MediaPipe, measured at 54% against ground truth and
documented under Limitations as unreliable.

The pose test is body-relative: whether the hitting arm crosses the shoulder midline
horizontally, which makes it independent of handedness, facing, and which side of the
court the player is on. That is the right idea and it is not sufficient, because a volley
is played with the body square to the net and the arm never crosses the midline at all.

## Optional: SAM 3D Body pose backend

MediaPipe drops the racket arm on 44-58% of backhands (see Limitations). SAM 3D Body
predicts a whole-body mesh and infers occluded joints instead of dropping them. On the
exact frames MediaPipe could not complete, it returned keypoints on **6 of 6**
(`eval/sam3d_occluded_arm_test.py`), and on a full backhand clip it completed 100% of
frames against MediaPipe's 88%.

It runs on **contact frames only**, roughly 15 per clip. At about 1.6s per frame a
per-frame pass would take half an hour on a mid-range GPU; 30 inferences takes under a
minute.

```bash
# 1. request access, then create a read token, then put HF_TOKEN in .env
python scripts/download_sam3d_body.py

# 2. the inference code is a separate repository
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam-3d-body.git
export SAM3D_BODY_CODE=/path/to/sam-3d-body

# 3. enable it
#    configs/config.yaml -> pipeline.use_sam3d_pose: true
```

Off by default. If it is switched on and the weights are absent the pipeline uses
MediaPipe and says so, rather than falling through in silence: the two backends measure
85.5% and 66.4% balanced on identical clips, so a run that quietly used the other one is
not the run that was asked for.

**On licensing.** The weights are under Meta's SAM License, not MIT. That licence grants
free use, modification and derivative works, and requires anyone *redistributing* the
materials to pass the same terms along. This project therefore does not bundle them:
doing so would have an MIT licence make a promise about Meta's weights it has no standing
to make. You fetch them under terms you accept directly, which is the same arrangement
already used for the TrackNet weights.

Verified working on a GTX 1050 Ti (4.3 GB) in float32. Do not wrap inference in
`torch.autocast`: the MHR head is a TorchScript module and raises `NotImplementedError`
inside one. Casting the weights fails in both directions as well.

## Measured results

Scripts marked `(dataset)` need a third-party dataset that is over 7 GB and not
redistributable. See `datasets/README.md` for sources. Everything else runs against what
ships in this repository plus the downloadable weights.

### Ball localization

Against the original TrackNet dataset's own hand-labelled coordinates, 16 clips.

| Metric | Result | Script |
|---|---|---|
| Detection rate (a position was output, **not** an accuracy) | 88.6% | `eval/ball_localization_accuracy.py` (dataset) |
| Localization error vs ground truth | median **5.4px**, 90th percentile 18.0px, at 360x640 | same |
| Located within 5px of the labelled centre | 46.8% of outputs, 42.5% of visible-ball frames | same |

Detection rate and accuracy are not the same measurement, and the gap here is large. The
detector reliably finds roughly where the ball is and is not pixel-precise. That is
adequate for trajectory shape, bounce timing and speed across a flight. It is marginal for
exact landing coordinates.

It is worth being precise about what this does and does not cost. It bounds the accuracy of
speeds, 3-D reconstruction and landing positions. It does **not** cost event recall: the
funnel below shows every labelled contact has a detected ball near it, so nothing is missed
for want of a detection.

### Contact and bounce event detection

Two questions with very different answers. Both are published, because the gap between
them is the honest cost of detection noise.

**Given perfect ball positions**, feeding the dataset's labelled coordinates straight into
the candidate generators. This isolates the generators and is an upper bound, not shipped
behaviour. 91 clips.

| Configuration | Recall | Precision | Script |
|---|---|---|---|
| y-reversal only | 75.8% | 88.9% | `eval/retest_union_candidates_full_pipeline.py` (dataset) |
| y-reversal + x-velocity union | 87.6% | 90.3% | same |

**Running real detection end to end**, which is what the pipeline does. 10 clips, 76
labelled contacts, trajectory classifier only.

| Configuration | Recall | Precision | F1 | Mean offset |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| mean of all heatmap pixels, chained clustering | 48.7% | 92.5% | 0.638 | 3.6 frames |
| largest connected component, chained clustering | 51.3% | 92.9% | 0.661 | 3.2 frames |
| **largest connected component, bounded clustering** (shipped) | **68.4%** | **92.9%** | **0.788** | **2.4 frames** |

Script: `eval/event_detection_on_real_detections.py` (dataset). Rows above are the same 10
clips throughout so the comparison is controlled.

On a wider 25-clip sample, 164 labelled contacts:

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Recall | **72.0%** |
| Precision | **95.9%** |
| F1 | **0.822** |
| Mean offset | 2.4 frames |
| Per-clip recall | min 50%, median 71%, max 100% |
| Clips below 40% recall | **0 of 25** |

The per-clip row matters more than the aggregate. A 72% mean could hide clips that fail
completely, and it does not: the worst clip in the sample still recovers half its contacts,
and none scores zero.

Where the remaining misses go, attributed by `eval/event_recall_funnel.py` across 12 clips
and 91 labelled contacts:

| Stage | Share of all contacts |
|---|---|
| reported | 68.1% |
| ball never detected nearby | **0.0%** |
| no candidate proposed | 15.4% |
| lost in candidate merging | 16.5% |
| rejected by the classifier | **0.0%** |

Detection reaches every labelled contact and the classifier discards none. Everything still
missing is lost in candidate generation or in merging, which is the opposite of what this
project assumed before the funnel existed.

### Hit versus bounce classification

Trajectory-only logistic regression on ball height, vertical and horizontal velocity
change, and whether the ball reversed horizontally. No player position needed. Trained on
820 events, tested on 214 held out, split by clip rather than by event so camera, lighting
and player correlations cannot leak.

**86.4% held-out accuracy.** See `eval/train_hit_bounce_classifier.py`.

The feature set was chosen on end-to-end F1, not on this accuracy, and the two disagree:

| Features | Held-out accuracy | End-to-end shot F1 |
|---|---|---|
| height, vertical, horizontal | 84.1% | 0.737 |
| plus raw signed velocities | **89.3%** | **0.600** |
| plus horizontal reversal (shipped) | 86.4% | **0.824** |

The most accurate model on the benchmark is the worst in the product. The cause is a train
and serve mismatch: the dataset's velocities come from hand-annotated positions, while the
pipeline computes them from real detections with interpolated gaps. Raw signed velocities
took the largest weights and did not survive contact with real data.

### Court keypoints

Held-out validation split of the TennisCourtDetector dataset, 2,211 images.

| Metric | Base weights | Fine-tuned (shipped) | Script |
|---|---|---|---|
| Median keypoint error | 4.03px | **2.90px** | `eval/court_keypoint_accuracy.py` (dataset) |
| Images with all 14 keypoints within 25px | 96.8% | **98.3%** | same |
| Real clips passing the court-validity gate | 4/9 | **8/9** | `eval/court_validity_calibration.py` (dataset) |

Fine-tuned with geometric augmentation only: translation, scale, perspective and flip.
Per-surface error is near-identical (hard 3.90px, clay 4.58px, grass 4.65px), so surface is
not the weakness. Camera framing is. Validated on Wimbledon grass the model had never seen.

The validity gate was calibrated by measurement, and one obvious approach was discarded:
homography reprojection error is useless for this. Across 9 clips it ranged 1.40 to 1.88px
on correct fits and 2.13px on a visibly wrong one, with 14 of 14 RANSAC inliers every time.
It measures whether the 14 points are self-consistent, and a tidy quadrilateral on the
stands is perfectly self-consistent.

### Shot type physics

`utils/shot_physics.py` tests Volley, Smash and Lob against physical facts rather than
court position: a smash is struck above the head and not from a baseline, a volley has no
bounce between it and the previous contact, a lob's 3-D apex is far above net height.

Across the 9 evaluation clips, 81 shots (`eval/physics_evidence_rate.py`):

| Outcome | Shots | Share |
|---|---|---|
| Positively evidenced as Volley, Smash or Lob | **1** | 1.2% |
| Downgraded to "Groundstroke" for lack of evidence | **20** | 24.7% |
| Serves evidenced separately by `utils/serve_detector.py` | 14 | 17.3% |

The layer rejects twenty labels for every one it evidences, which makes it a validation
filter rather than a classifier, and it is described as one throughout. That is not a
failure: a quarter of all shots would otherwise carry a confident Volley or Smash label
with nothing behind it. Serve detection is the contrast and does fire positively, because
serves are common and smashes are not.

Two of the nine clips saw the layer do nothing at all: no evidence and no rejections.

### Serve speed

Validated against broadcast radar, which is third-party ground truth rather than a
self-generated reference.

| Clip | Pipeline | Broadcast radar |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 213.4 km/h | 214.0 km/h |
| 2 | 164.1 km/h | 177.0 km/h |

Mean ratio 0.96, always at or below radar, which is what aerodynamic drag predicts given
that radar reads at racket contact. Reproduce with `eval/serve_speed_accuracy.py`.

### Rally coherence

A rally has orderings that cannot happen: a player cannot hit twice in succession, and a
ball cannot bounce twice with play continuing. Where the reported sequence contains one,
an event is provably missing, and that is checkable with no ground truth at all. So this
is measured on every clip rather than only the labelled one.

The hit/bounce classifier labels each event alone, so its errors compound into impossible
rallies. `utils/rally_decode.py` re-labels the sequence as a whole, keeping the most likely
labelling the rules permit, and discarding candidates that have no legal place in it.

| Metric | Without decoding | With decoding | Script |
|---|---|---|---|
| Events the ordering proves are missing (9 clips) | 83 | **35** | `eval/rally_coherence.py` |
| Clips improved | | 10 of 10, none worse | same |
| Contact recall, 40 labelled clips | 75.9% | **75.9%** | `eval/event_detection_on_real_detections.py` |
| Shot recall on the labelled clip | 100% | 100% | `eval/shot_frame_accuracy.py` |
| Shot false positives on the labelled clip | 7 | 8 | same |

The coherence number alone would be trivially gamed by discarding every candidate, so it is
only quoted next to the recall it cost. Discarding does cost recall as it gets more
aggressive, monotonically, which is why the shipped setting is the smallest one that gets
the full coherence benefit rather than the one with the best coherence score.

What it costs: one extra false-positive shot on the reference clip. That clip has 7 labelled
shots, so a single event is inside its noise, and the dataset-scale recall it is traded
against is unchanged. The cost is listed rather than left out.

It cannot recover an event that was never detected: a missing contact stays missing, and
the audit still reports it.

### Held-out benchmark

Everything above this line is measured on data that influenced the system: the nine
evaluation clips calibrated the court threshold, swept the rally deletion prior, and
produced the frame-rate and physics figures. Numbers from them describe performance on
data the system was fitted to.

This section is different. Fourteen clips were cut from a region of source video that has
never influenced any threshold, model choice or feature selection, and the manifest was
frozen before a single clip was viewed. The selection rule is arithmetic and stated in
`datasets/heldout/manifest.json`, so the set cannot have been curated. Nothing was dropped
afterwards for looking bad.

**Its limits, first.** One match, one surface, one broadcast production, two players,
25 fps throughout. It measures generalization *within* broadcast tennis, not across
domains, and it cannot exercise the frame-rate gate. There is no handheld, phone, clay or
hard-court footage in it, and none was fabricated to fill the table. It has no frame-level
ground truth, so it produces **no precision or recall figures** and none are claimed.

#### Part A - arbitrary 15-second broadcast windows

| Result | |
|---|---|
| Clips analysed | 14 |
| **Reported numbers** | **0** |
| **Refused** | **14** |
| Crashes | 0 |
| Valid `summary.json` written | 14 / 14 |
| Fabricated positions | 0 |
| Silent algorithm fallbacks | 0 |

Every clip was refused, and that is the correct outcome. A fixed-length window cut from a
broadcast is not one rally: it routinely contains the end of a point, a crowd shot, a
replay and the next serve, and **this pipeline assumes a single continuous camera take.**
Scoring court line support frame by frame shows it plainly:

```
development clip   0.44 0.48 0.53 0.56 0.57 0.61 0.65 0.65 0.62 0.69 0.73 0.59   12/12
held-out H00       0.05 0.06 0.05 | 0.60 0.58 0.59 0.57 0.47 | 0.01 0.03 0.00 0.04  5/12
held-out H13       0.12 0.14 0.14 0.06 0.13 0.14 0.16 0.08 0.14 0.15 0.06 0.06     0/12
```

Seven of the fourteen windows contain a real court segment with cuts either side. Seven
never show a playable court at all.

The apparent four-way failure (ball 100%, court 93%, players 71%) collapses to that one
cause. Ball coverage on H00 is 27% across the whole window and **59% on its court segment
alone**, against 73% on a development clip, so roughly two thirds of the ball failure was
downstream of the cuts rather than a detector problem.

**What Part A actually demonstrates** is the refusal architecture under adversarial input.
Fourteen clips the system could not handle produced zero fabricated numbers, zero crashes,
and a specific reason each time. Since this run, a failed court fit also says *which* kind
of failure it is, because "5 of 12 frames do show a valid court, trim the clip" and "no
part of this clip shows a court" need different things from the user.

Reproduce with `eval/heldout_benchmark.py`; the per-clip record is committed in
`datasets/heldout/results.json`.

#### Part B - the tennis inside those windows

The same frozen clips, with the court-valid segment located and analysed. Reported
separately because "does it survive camera cuts" and "does it analyse tennis" are
different questions, and merging them would hide both answers. Only measurements
*downstream* of the court gate are reported, so the segment selection cannot flatter them.

Five of the fourteen clips contain a court-valid segment of at least four seconds.

| Clip | Segment | Court | Players | Ball | Shots | Serves | 3-D segs | Shot speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H00 | 6.0 s | 0.558 | ok | 57% | 3 | 1 | 1 | 172 km/h |
| H04 | 4.8 s | 0.458 | ok | 41% | 1 | 0 | 0 | unavailable |
| H05 | 8.4 s | 0.482 | ok | 72% | 3 | 1 | 1 | 70 km/h |
| H07 | 4.8 s | 0.502 | ok | 62% | 4 | 1 | 3 | 108-141 km/h |
| H10 | 5.4 s | 0.542 | ok | 76% | 5 | 2 | 3 | 87-112 km/h |

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Court calibrated | **5 / 5** |
| Player selection `ok` | **5 / 5** (no failures, no degraded) |
| Ball coverage | median **62%**, range 41-76% |
| Shots reported | 16 across 5 segments |
| Serves evidenced | 5 |

On footage never used for tuning, and given a continuous view of play, the court gate and
the player gate both pass everywhere. Ball coverage runs about 11 points below the
development clip's 73%, which is a real grass-domain gap and the honest cost of never
having tuned on this footage.

Reproduce with `eval/heldout_segments.py`.

### Reference clip, end to end

One clip with 7 hand-labelled shots. Listed because it is the reproducible demo, not
because 7 events settle anything. The dataset-scale numbers above are the ones to trust,
and on precision they disagree with this clip.

| Metric | Result | Script |
|---|---|---|
| Shot-frame recall | 7/7 found, mean offset 7.9 frames | `eval/shot_frame_accuracy.py` |
| Shot-frame precision | 46.7%, 8 false positives in 15 reported, F1 0.636 | same |
| Ball speed plausibility (a range check, **not** accuracy) | 21/21 within physical bounds | `eval/speed_accuracy.py` |

### Runtime

Measured, on the hardware this project is developed on. No real-time claim is made and
none is close.

Reference clip: `input_video_2.mp4`, 570 frames, 1280x720, 30 fps, **19.0 s of video**.
Hardware: **NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti (4 GB), CUDA, PyTorch 2.13, Python 3.12**.

| Run | Wall clock | vs real time |
|---|---|---|
| Full analysis, fresh detection (`--no-stubs`, the default) | **5 m 51 s** | 18.5x slower |
| Re-analysis with cached detections (`-c configs/dev.yaml`) | **1 m 04 s** | 3.4x slower |

Where the time goes on a fresh run: YOLOv8x player detection **2 m 35 s**, TrackNet plus
per-frame court keypoints **2 m 35 s**, everything else including rendering about 40 s.
The two detectors are essentially the whole cost, and both scale linearly with frame
count, so a 2-minute clip is roughly 35 minutes on this card.

A modern GPU will be considerably faster and is not measured here, because publishing a
number from hardware nobody ran would be the sort of estimate this README exists to avoid.
Use `--max-frames 60` for a quick check before committing to a full clip.

Caching is off by default on purpose: a stub holds one video's detections, and loading it
while analysing a different clip produces confident nonsense. `configs/dev.yaml` turns it
on for repeated runs against the same clip.

### Test suite

**545 unit and integration tests** (`pytest tests/`), covering ball-state classification,
Kalman and RTS smoothing including the physical speed-plausibility gate, mini-court
coordinate mapping, trajectory drawing, pose-based shot classification, the hit and bounce
classifier and its feature contract, the rally grammar and its decoder, the no-ground-truth
rally audit, TrackNet postprocessing geometry, detection-cache keying, hand-placed court
calibration and the court region it defines, and packaging integrity.

The end-to-end smoke test runs genuine fresh detection and depends on no cached artefacts,
so it fails for everyone if the pipeline breaks.

## What we tried that did not work

Published because negative results are expensive to produce and cheap to reuse. Each of
these was implemented, measured, and rejected on the number.

**Homography reprojection error as a court-validity signal.** Cannot distinguish a court
fitted to the court from one fitted to the stands, for the reason given above.

**Raising the ball detector's heatmap threshold, and changing its minimum cluster size.**
Thresholds from 0 to 128 and cluster sizes from 3 to 10 all land within noise of each other.
The shipped configuration is already at its optimum for this postprocess. The remaining
error is in the network's output, not in how it is thresholded.

**A larger or newer YOLO for player detection.** Detection is already saturated: on the
reference clip YOLOv8x finds 11 to 14 people per frame and the pipeline needs 2. The hard
problem is selecting which two are the players, which is our own logic, not the detector's.

**RTS forward-backward smoothing of the ball trajectory.** Buys complete coverage and about
1.5 points of recall for 4% worse median error. Two useful findings came out of it.
Smoothing across a contact is measurably worse than smoothing between contacts, because a
racket hit changes velocity discontinuously and a constant-velocity smoother run through
one blends the incoming and outgoing velocities. And even applied per flight span it does
not improve median error, because TrackNet's error is not Gaussian: a 5.4px median against
an 18.0px 90th percentile is a heavy tail of gross mislocalizations, and a Kalman smoother
spreads those into neighbouring good frames instead of rejecting them. Shipped as a tested
utility, off by default.

**A chi-square outlier gate in front of that smoother.** Catastrophic on real data, taking
median error from 6.3px to 29.4px, and to 207.9px at tight tuning. It diverges: the
constant-velocity prediction is too poor to serve as a reference, so the gate rejects
correct measurements and coasts on a wrong track. Gating is the right idea for choosing
among several candidate detections per frame, which is a different job. Our postprocess
emits exactly one position, so a gate can only discard.

**The ratio of outgoing to incoming vertical speed as a bounce signal.** The physics is
sound, since a floor bounce can only lose vertical speed while a racket adds it, and the
medians do separate: 2.04 for hits against 0.98 for bounces. But it reaches only 65.7%
accuracy on 1,034 labelled events, because at broadcast camera angles vertical pixel speed
is substantially measuring depth rather than energy.

**Replacing MediaPipe with SAM 3D Body for forehand/backhand.** SAM 3D Body recovers the
occluded racket arm that MediaPipe drops on 44-58% of backhands, taking usable clips from
171 to 200 and from a 55/45 class skew to a perfect 100/100 balance. It also made the
classifier substantially worse:

| configuration | balanced | forehand | backhand |
|---|---|---|---|
| MediaPipe, shared clips only | **85.5%** | 83.5% | 87.4% |
| SAM 3D, shared clips only | 66.4% | 71.6% | 61.3% |

Measured on identical clips, so this is not about the extra data. The landmark mapping was
verified against MediaPipe on frames where both succeed and agrees within 1-3 pixels, so it
is not an integration error either.

The damage is confined to position, not motion:

| feature subset | MediaPipe | SAM 3D |
|---|---|---|
| wrist side only | 78.6% | **51.8%** (chance) |
| speed and reach only | 63.1% | 65.8% |

On frames where the arm is occluded, MediaPipe declines and SAM 3D infers the arm from a
body prior. That inference is anatomically plausible and it is still a guess about where
the racket is, and it destroys exactly the signal that decides forehand from backhand.

The lesson is one this project already claims to hold: MediaPipe's refusal was a quality
filter, not only a loss. A model that always answers is not better than one that knows when
to stay quiet. The optional backend remains in the tree for its coverage, meshes and camera
estimates, and is off by default.

**A trained forehand/backhand classifier on pose features.** Scores 76.3% balanced on
THETIS with subject-grouped splits and repeated cross-validation, against 54% for the
hand-crafted geometry it was built to replace. On real broadcast images it scores 53.6%,
statistically the same as the rule, with the bias flipped rather than removed. Everything
about the training was methodologically sound and it would still have been a regression in
production. Kept, measured, not wired in.

**"The first shot in a sequence is a serve."** This was the original serve rule. It only
holds if a clip begins exactly at the start of a point, and ours are cut from mid-match, so
every "Serve" the pipeline ever reported was this heuristic firing rather than a serve being
recognised.

## Limitations

**Wrong or unvalidated today:**

- **Rally and groundstroke speeds are unvalidated.** 3-D reconstruction produces 62 to
  153 km/h with a mean of 92 on the reference clip, and the physics is verified, but no
  ground truth exists for non-serve shots. Serve speed is validated; rally speed is not.

  The dominant uncertainty is not the one you would expect. `trajectory_3d.py` used to
  list drag, spin and contact height as its honest limits, and all three are smaller than
  event timing, which the list omitted. Speed is distance over flight time, flight time
  comes from event frames, and the measured mean event offset is 2.4 frames:

  | source of error | mean | median | worst |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | **event timing (±2.4 frames)** | **12.5%** | 12.2% | 28.0% |
  | contact height (±0.20 m) | 0.7% | 0.2% | 3.5% |
  | ball localization (±0.09 m) | 0.1% | 0.1% | 0.7% |

  Measured on 25 real segments by `eval/speed_timing_sensitivity.py`. Sensitivity scales
  as 1/T, so flights under 0.5 s average 23.9% and flights over 1.0 s average 6.5%. A
  reconstructed speed is about as accurate as the event detector is punctual, which is
  why adding drag or Magnus terms would be modelling the small terms first.

- **Not every reconstructed segment is a shot, and the report says which.** A rally
  alternates contact, bounce, contact, so only a segment that begins at a racket contact
  is a ball leaving a racket. On the reference clip 25 segments reconstruct, of which 13
  are shots, 11 are post-bounce legs travelling to the receiver, and 1 is flagged as an
  outlier (struck and landing on the striker's own side without crossing the net, which
  breaks the free-flight assumption). Averaging all 25 into one figure is what previously
  put an 18 km/h reading next to a 170 km/h one and called both "shot speed".
- **Roughly a quarter to a third of contacts in a rally are missed** (72.0% recall on real
  detections, 95.9% precision). Reported events are overwhelmingly real, so the shot count
  is an under-count rather than noise.
- **Forehand versus backhand is unreliable, and measured as such.** Against THETIS ground
  truth (120 clips, 8 classes, balanced by construction) the pose geometry scores **54%**,
  which is barely above chance on a two-class problem, and it predicts forehand **89%** of
  the time. It is accurate on forehands (87-100%) and fails on backhands (0-47%).

  Two separate causes, both measured with `eval/forehand_backhand_on_thetis.py`. Choosing
  which wrist is the hitting hand accounts for about 24 points. The side projection itself
  accounts for the rest: even given the correct hand it tops out at 78%, and on volleys it
  reaches only 27%, because a volley is blocked with the body square to the net and the
  wrist never crosses the shoulder midline the test depends on.

  A trained classifier was built to replace it and **did not survive the transfer test**.
  On THETIS it scores 76.3% balanced with subject-grouped splits, fixing the asymmetry
  (forehand 78.9%, backhand 73.7%). On real broadcast images it scores **53.6%**, which is
  the same as the rule, and the bias flips direction rather than merely weakening
  (forehand 39.1%, backhand 68.0%). See `eval/validate_on_broadcast_images.py`.

  That test is handicapped: 8 of the 20 features describe motion and a still image has
  none, so it is a lower bound rather than a like-for-like comparison. But it is the only
  broadcast evidence that exists, and it does not support shipping the classifier. It is
  trained, measured and committed, and deliberately not wired into the pipeline.

  The common cause of both failures is upstream, and it is more specific than "pose
  fails". MediaPipe finds the player on **100%** of frames and then omits the landmarks of
  the occluded arm. On a backhand that is the racket arm:

  | class | frames | no pose | most-missing landmarks |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | backhand_volley | 117 | 0 | right elbow 68%, right wrist **58%** |
  | backhand | 142 | 0 | right elbow 47%, right wrist **44%** |
  | forehand_volley | 120 | 0 | left elbow 9%, left wrist 5% |
  | forehand_flat | 146 | 0 | left elbow 25%, left wrist 23% |

  Forehand versus backhand is decided by where that arm is, so both classifiers are
  reading a hand that is often not there. That is why a stronger pose model is the fix
  rather than a better classifier on the same landmarks, and it is measured by
  `eval/pose_availability_at_contacts.py`.

- **Volley and smash are not classified, they are filtered.** `utils/shot_physics.py` was
  built to replace the position-guessed Volley and Smash labels with physically evidenced
  ones. Measured across the 9 evaluation clips, 81 shots, it evidences **1** and rejects
  **20**, a 20-to-1 ratio (`eval/physics_evidence_rate.py`). On broadcast rallies almost
  nothing is a volley or a smash, so what it actually does is downgrade a quarter of all
  shots to "Groundstroke" for lack of evidence. That is worth having and it is a
  validation filter, not a classifier, and this README calls it one.

  Serve is the contrast: genuine positive physical evidence, firing 14 times across the
  same 81 shots. The difference is not that physics works for one and not the other, it
  is that serves are common and smashes are not.
- **The learned temporal shot classifier is not wired into the pipeline.** It scores 73.4%
  on unseen subjects across 6 classes, but it is trained on THETIS indoor demonstration
  footage and its transfer to broadcast video is unmeasured.
- **Player detection has no ground-truth eval.** Precision, recall, IDF1 and ID switches
  need labelled boxes that do not exist for this footage. What does exist is a sanity
  check that needs no labels, because singles is played across the net: two selected
  tracks on the same half cannot both be players. Across the 9 evaluation clips
  (`eval/player_selection_sanity.py`), **6 of 9 pass every check**:

  | Clip | Court gate | Player selection |
  |---|---|---|
  | 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 | pass | pass |
  | 4 | pass (0.476) | degraded, 26-frame gaps |
  | 6 | **fail** (0.071) | fail |
  | 11 | pass (0.327) | **fail**, both tracks one side of the net |

  Clip 11 is the interesting one and it is why the pipeline gained a second gate. Its
  court fits fine, so nothing stopped the run, and it still selected two tracks on the
  same half with one of them present for 40% of frames. Player-selection quality is now
  assessed on every run and reported in `summary.json`, the same way court validity is.
- **Ball height is modelled, not measured**, and cannot be otherwise from this camera
  geometry. It is anchored at known contact heights and interpolated by gravity, so it
  degrades whenever a contact is missed.

**Out of scope right now:**

- **Ground-level cameras fail.** Validated on broadcast and elevated fixed-camera footage
  only. The validity gate flags these rather than reporting wrong numbers.
- **Doubles and amateur footage are untested.** Every evaluation clip is broadcast singles.
- **Frame rates outside 23 to 31 fps are not supported.** See below.
- **A clip containing a camera cut is refused whole.** There is no shot-boundary
  detection, and the court gate judges the clip by its median frame. On the held-out
  benchmark that refused 14 of 14 arbitrary broadcast windows. Trim to one rally and it
  analyses; the refusal message says how many frames were usable.
- **Ball coverage on unseen footage runs lower than on the development clips.** Median 62%
  across the held-out segments against 73% on a development clip and 88.6% on the labelled
  dataset. The three numbers measure different things and the lowest one is the one a new
  user should expect.

## Supported inputs

### One continuous take, one rally

**The pipeline assumes the clip is a single uninterrupted view of play.** It has no
shot-boundary detection, so a clip spanning a camera cut is refused as a whole even when
part of it is a perfectly good court view.

This is not a theoretical limit. The held-out benchmark cut fourteen fixed-length windows
from a broadcast and every one was refused, because a broadcast window routinely contains
the end of a point, a crowd reaction, a replay and the next serve. Trimmed to the rally
inside them, five of five had a valid court and valid player selection.

| Input | Status |
|---|---|
| One rally, continuous camera, court in view | **Supported** |
| A clip containing a camera cut, replay or crowd shot | **Refused**, with the reason and how many frames were usable |
| A full match | **Unsupported.** No point segmentation, and 18.5x real time makes it impractical |

If a clip is refused for this reason the output says so specifically, including how many
of the sampled frames did show a valid court, so trimming is an obvious next step rather
than a guess.

### Frame rate

Every threshold in the event-detection path is counted in **frames**, and the two largest
weights in the hit/bounce classifier are velocities in **pixels per frame**. None of it is
normalised by frame rate, so the same tennis sampled at a different rate produces a
different event set. Every evaluation clip here runs between 23.57 and 29.82 fps and both
input videos are 30.0, so the entire measured record sits inside one narrow band.

| Frame rate | Status | What to expect |
|---|---|---|
| 23 to 31 fps | **Supported** | The range every number on this page was measured on |
| 18 to 23, 31 to 50 fps | **Partially supported** | Runs, and event counts are wrong in a known direction |
| below 18 or above 50 fps | **Unsupported** | Event counts should not be treated as measurements |

Measured by resampling the reference clip's ball track and running the real generators and
the real classifier over it. Events per second is the comparison that means something,
since the rally contains the same contacts however fast it was sampled:

| fps | events/s | vs 30 fps | contact:bounce |
|---|---|---|---|
| 15 | 0.84 | -43% | 10:6 |
| 18 | 1.05 | -29% | 9:11 |
| 24 | 1.37 | -7% | 15:11 |
| **30** | **1.47** | **baseline** | **14:14** |
| 36 | 1.79 | +21% | 14:20 |
| 50 | 2.21 | +50% | 15:27 |
| 60 | 2.42 | +64% | 11:35 |

Two failures in opposite directions. Too slow and real events are never proposed. Too fast
and the generators fire more often while the per-frame velocities shrink, so the classifier
calls almost everything a bounce: 11 contacts to 35 bounces on a rally with roughly 14 of
each. **60 fps is ordinary footage and it is genuinely not supported today.**

One caveat on the method, in the direction that matters: below 30 fps the resampling
discards information, which is what a slower camera does. Above 30 fps it invents
intermediate points a real fast camera would have measured independently, and cannot model
sharper motion or reduced blur. The high-rate rows are a **lower bound** on the disruption,
not an estimate of it.

The pipeline still analyses an out-of-band clip rather than refusing it, and stamps the
rendered video, the log and `summary.json` with what it cannot vouch for. Normalising the
event path to seconds and metres and retraining is the real fix; it is post-launch work,
because it would invalidate every number above in the process.

Also unsupported: doubles, ground-level cameras, and any clip whose court fit fails the
validity gate. All three are reported rather than guessed at.

## Roadmap

Ordered by measured value, not by interest.

1. **Labelled broadcast video for shot types, before any more modelling.** Three
   approaches have now been measured on forehand/backhand and none is trustworthy: the
   geometric rule (54%), a trained classifier (76.3% indoors, 53.6% on broadcast), and
   swapping in a stronger pose model (66.4%, worse than MediaPipe on identical clips). Each
   was chosen on reasoning and rejected on measurement. What is missing is not a better
   model, it is ground truth on the footage this actually runs on, which
   `tools/label_shots.py` produces.

2. **A stronger pose model used as a supplement, not a replacement.** SAM 3D Body gives
   100% landmark coverage, body meshes and camera parameters. Used naively it is worse than
   MediaPipe (above), but its camera estimate is an independent check on the homography,
   which is currently validated only by image evidence.
3. **A smarter merge decision.** A fixed frame window is the wrong instrument: it still
   loses 16.5% of contacts, which are real events genuinely closer together than the
   window. Two candidates should merge because the trajectory says they describe one
   physical event, not because they are near each other in time. This is the largest
   remaining bucket.
4. **Candidate generation.** A further 15.4% of contacts are never proposed by any of the
   three generators, so they are blind to some event shape. Finding out which is a
   labelling exercise, not a modelling one.
5. **Ball localization.** Median 5.4px, 18.0px tail. Demoted from first place, because the
   funnel shows it costs zero recall: every labelled contact has a detected ball nearby.
   It still bounds the accuracy of speeds, 3-D reconstruction and landing positions, which
   is why it stays on the list.
6. **Audio impact detection.** A racket strike and a floor bounce are sharp broadband
   transients that a broadcast mix carries clearly. Audio cannot say where the ball is, but
   it says precisely when it was struck, including while the ball is hidden behind a player
   or the net. It is the most promising route to the contacts no generator proposes.
7. **Player-height-normalised contact distance.** The current threshold is a raw pixel
   constant, which is wrong at different resolutions and at different depths within a single
   frame. Dividing by the player's own pixel height converts pixels to metres at that
   player's depth without needing to know the ball's height.
8. **Geometric court detection.** The four cross-court lines have a projective-invariant
   cross-ratio that is identical under any camera view, so a court can be found by searching
   for that signature rather than by a learned model. This would remove the per-surface
   fine-tuning dependency entirely.
9. **Broadcast ground truth for shot types**, so the temporal classifier can be validated
   and wired in, or dropped.

the key assumption and the failure mode, because the failure modes are the part worth
