───────────────────────
Guards the two ways this project can ship a silently degraded pipeline.

Neither failure mode raises an error at runtime. Both produce a pipeline that runs to
completion and reports numbers worse than the README's measured ones, with nothing in
the output admitting it. That makes them worse than a crash, so they get tests.

1. `main._DEFAULTS` drifting from `configs/config.yaml`. The defaults are not a minimal
   fallback, they are what actually runs for anyone who installed the wheel instead of
   cloning, since the wheel ships no YAML. When they drifted, wheel users got the
   superseded court model (median 4.03px against 2.90px, 4 of 9 clips passing against 8),
   the YOLO ball detector instead of TrackNet, and no pose-based shot classification.

2. The hit/bounce weights path resolving against the working directory. As a bare
   relative path it only worked when the process was started from the repo root; from
   anywhere else the weights were "not found", every event classified as None, and the
   pipeline fell back to the player-proximity heuristic without saying so.
