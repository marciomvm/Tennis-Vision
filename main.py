    #      displaced along the camera ray - the very error this module removes. The
    #      floor-valid measurement at a contact is the hitting player's FEET.
    #   2. ball_mini_court positions are clamped to the drawing panel's bounds, which
    #      is right for pixels on screen and wrong for physics input: a wide bounce
    #      snapped to the panel edge silently shortens the segment.
    # Positions are origin-referenced to the court's far-left corner so the emitted
    # JSON is genuine court-frame metres, as the viewer expects.
